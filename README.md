# Details
In order to compile all libraries execute the makefile in the project root folder.
Inside each folder there's also a main.c file thats used to test libraries, you are free to run it too.

# Warnings
 - Compiled libraries are provided as .dll
 - Modify makefile if you are going to use it in unix-like Os (or wait until i load a better makefile)
